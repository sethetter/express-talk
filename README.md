# beer list

An example [express](http://expressjs.com) application for my [DevICT](http://devict.org) presentation.

## what's it do?

- Keeps track of beers you've tried in [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) using [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
- API endpoints for POST /beers, GET /beers, and DELETE /beers/:id


Yep, that's it.
